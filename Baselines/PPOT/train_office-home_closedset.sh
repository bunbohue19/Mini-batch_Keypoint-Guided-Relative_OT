# m-PPOT on Office-Home in CLOSED-SET DA mode (65 common / 0 source-private / 0 target-private)
#
# This script is for an apples-to-apples comparison with m-KPOT, which runs
# closed-set DA on all 12 Office-Home transfers.
#
# In closed-set mode:
#   - source and target share all 65 classes
#   - α ≈ β ≈ 1 → partial-OT degenerates to full OT
#   - L_ne (negative entropy on "unknown" samples) becomes inactive
#   - Comparable metric: per-class accuracy (NOT H-score, since there are no
#     unknown samples to classify).
#
# Important: this requires patching train.py to accept --closed-set OR setting
# `common_class=65, source_private_class=0, target_private_class=0` directly.
# The simplest patch is two lines in train.py.  See the README block below.
#
# Usage:
#   bash train_office-home_closedset.sh
#
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${1:-0}
